### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a task management application utilizing C#. This application aims to provide users with a straightforward yet effective interface for task administration. With a standard Windows graphical user interface, the application will facilitate the creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of tasks, thereby enhancing user productivity and organization.

#### 1.1 Key Features
- **Home Page:** This page functions as the central hub, providing an overview of task categories or recent tasks, as well as facilitating quick access to other views.
- **List View:** This feature offers users a categorized overview of all their tasks, thereby enhancing the ability to track multiple task lists (e.g., Work, Personal, etc.). Users can sort, filter, and search for tasks within each category.
**Task View:** This component presents detailed information regarding each task. Users may add new tasks, modify existing ones, or designate tasks as completed. The view accommodates task priorities, due dates, and status tracking.

### 2. Diagrams
#### 2.1. Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
| Class | Description | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TaskManager | It contains a list of task lists (TaskList objects) and tracks the currently selected task. | It provides methods for creating, removing, and updating task lists, as well as methods for sorting and filtering tasks at the application level. Acts as the "Controller" in an MVC architecture. | 
| TaskList | It represents a list of tasks, containing a collection of Task objects. | It provides methods for adding, editing, removing tasks, and performing list-level operations like sorting, filtering, or searching tasks. |
| Task | It represents an individual task. Attributes include task name, description, due date, priority, and status. It may also include methods to update its attributes. | It implements INotifyPropertyChanged to notify the UI when properties (such as status) are updated. |
| Priority | This is an Enum task representing task priority (High, Medium, Low). | It is used to prioritize tasks for better management and display purposes. |
| Status | This is an enum representing task status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started). | It provides the foundation for task tracking and filtering. |
| TaskView | A user interface component that displays details for a selected task. | It provides buttons and forms to edit the task, mark it as completed, or delete it. Communicates changes to TaskList. |
| ListView | The view that displays all tasks in a selected TaskList. | Users can sort, filter, or search for tasks from this view, and it updates based on the TaskList data source. |

#### 2.2 Class Relationships and Design Patterns
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TaskManager** | It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure a single point of control for task management across the application. |
| **TaskList** | Each TaskList contains multiple Task objects, forming a one-to-many relationship. | 
| **Task** | It could implement the Observer pattern using events (e.g., INotifyPropertyChanged) to notify the user interface when task properties change. This ensures that updates in task details are reflected across all relevant views in real-time. | 
| **TaskView** and **ListView** | The Task class is bound to the user interface using data-binding principles. Whenever task attributes such as name, due date, or status are updated, the corresponding UI views are automatically updated to reflect these changes. | 
| **Status** and **Priority** | Both Priority and Status enums are used throughout the application for filtering, sorting, and intuitively displaying tasks. They also play a role in defining the business logic (e.g., only Progress tasks are displayed by default on the home screen). |
