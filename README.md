## 1. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a task management application utilizing C#. This application is intended to provide users with a clear and effective interface for task administration. By fostering user productivity, the application enables the straightforward creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of tasks, thereby assisting users in maintaining organization and focusing on their priorities.

### 1.1 Key Features
- Task creation, viewing, updating, and deletion
- Categorization of tasks
- Prioritization and deadline setting
- User-friendly interface
- Data Persistence
- Notifications and Reminders

## 2. Diagrams
### 2.1. Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
| Class | Description | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TaskManager | It contains a list of task lists (TaskList objects) and tracks the currently selected task. | It provides methods for creating, removing, and updating task lists, as well as methods for sorting and filtering tasks at the application level. Acts as the "Controller" in an MVC architecture. | 
| TaskList | It represents a list of tasks, containing a collection of Task objects. | It provides methods for adding, editing, removing tasks, and performing list-level operations like sorting, filtering, or searching tasks. |
| Task | It represents an individual task. Attributes include task name, description, due date, priority, and status. It may also include methods to update its attributes. | It implements INotifyPropertyChanged to notify the UI when properties (such as status) are updated. |
| Priority | This is an Enum task representing task priority (High, Medium, Low). | It is used to prioritize tasks for better management and display purposes. |
| Status | This is an enum representing task status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started). | It provides the foundation for task tracking and filtering. |
| TaskView | A user interface component that displays details for a selected task. | It provides buttons and forms to edit the task, mark it as completed, or delete it. Communicates changes to TaskList. |
| ListView | The view that displays all tasks in a selected TaskList. | Users can sort, filter, or search for tasks from this view, and it updates based on the TaskList data source. |

### 2.2 Class Relationships and Design Patterns
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TaskManager** | It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure a single point of control for task management across the application. |
| **TaskList** | Each TaskList contains multiple Task objects, forming a one-to-many relationship. | 
| **Task** | It could implement the Observer pattern using events (e.g., INotifyPropertyChanged) to notify the user interface when task properties change. This ensures that updates in task details are reflected across all relevant views in real-time. | 
| **TaskView** and **ListView** | The Task class is bound to the user interface using data-binding principles. Whenever task attributes such as name, due date, or status are updated, the corresponding UI views are automatically updated to reflect these changes. | 
| **Status** and **Priority** | Both Priority and Status enums are used throughout the application for filtering, sorting, and intuitively displaying tasks. They also play a role in defining the business logic (e.g., only Progress tasks are displayed by default on the home screen). |
